📖 Overview
Predictive maintenance leverages machine learning to forecast potential machinery failures before they occur. This project implements a predictive model for industrial equipment, reducing downtime and optimizing maintenance schedules.

🎯 Objectives
-Predict machinery failure using sensor data
-Reduce unplanned downtime in industries
-Optimize maintenance schedules
-Improve overall equipment efficiency

🏗️ Project Workflow
1.Data Collection – Industrial sensor dataset (vibration, temperature, pressure, etc.)
2.Data Preprocessing – Handling missing values, normalization, feature engineering
3.Model Building – Applied ML models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.)
4.Evaluation – Metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
5.Visualization – Machine health trends, failure predictions
6.Deployment – Streamlit-based web app for interactive prediction
